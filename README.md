MapLibre Tracer (GeoJSON Image Overlay)A web-based tool for overlaying floor plan images onto a map and tracing features to generate GeoJSON data. Built with MapLibre GL JS and OpenFreeMap.🔗 Live Demo: https://jojseph.github.io/geojson-Image_Overlay/📖 OverviewThis project allows users to digitize indoor spaces or map features by overlaying reference images (such as floor plans) onto a geographical map. Users can trace specific areas (like rooms), assign metadata (Name, ID), and export the final geometry as standard GeoJSON.✨ FeaturesInteractive 3D Map: Powered by MapLibre, supporting rotation, pitching, and smooth zooming.Image Overlay: Layer floor plans or reference images over the map with adjustable opacity.Digitizing Tools: Trace rooms and areas directly on top of the overlay.Attribute Editing: Assign specific properties (Room Name, ID) to traced features.GeoJSON Export: Download your traced data instantly for use in GIS software (QGIS, ArcGIS, etc.) or other applications.🕹️ ControlsActionInputPan MapLeft Click + DragRotate MapRight Click + DragPitch (3D Tilt)Ctrl + DragZoomScroll Wheel🚀 Usage GuideNavigation: Use the mouse controls to position the map over your target area.Floor Plan Settings:Use the Floor Plan section in the sidebar to adjust the Opacity of the overlay to see the underlying map or the drawing clearly.Tracing & Editing:Draw or select a room/area on the map.In the Selected Room panel, enter the Room Name and optional ID.Export:Click the Export GeoJSON button in the Data section to save your work locally.🛠️ Tech StackMap Engine: MapLibre GL JSTiles: OpenFreeMapFormat: GeoJSON📦 Local DevelopmentTo run this project locally:Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/jojseph/geojson-Image_Overlay.git](https://github.com/jojseph/geojson-Image_Overlay.git)
